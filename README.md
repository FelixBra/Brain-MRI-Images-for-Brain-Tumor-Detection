# Brain-MRI-Images-for-Brain-Tumor-Detection

I. Introduction

This topic originally stems from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection).

The purpose of this project is to help finding potential tumors in the MRI images of the patients brains. In the picture above we can nicely see the difference between tumors ([0. 1.]) and non-tumors ([1. 0.]). Finding tumors in an early stage could be the difference between life and death for the patient. 

II. Objective

Image recognition has been implemented via convolutional neural networks (CNN), written in Python and using Keras (Tensorflow backend) as the framework. More specifically, my personal objective in this project is to have a simple comparison between self-made CNNs (build from scratch) and more famous CNNs (e.g. vgg16).
